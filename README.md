# Young People Survey Describition
# Introduction

In 2013, students of the Statistics class at [FSEV
UK](https://fses.uniba.sk/en/) were asked to invite their friends to
participate in this survey.

* The data file (`responses.csv`) consists of 1010 rows and 150 columns (139
integer and 11 categorical).
* For convenience, the original variable names were shortened in the
data file. See the `columns.csv` file if you want to match the data with the original names.
* The data contain missing values.
* The survey was presented to participants in both electronic and written form.
* The original questionnaire was in Slovak language and was later translated
into English.
* All participants were of Slovakian nationality, aged between 15-30.

The variables can be split into the following groups:

* **Music preferences** (19 items)
* **Movie preferences** (12 items)
* **Hobbies & interests** (32 items)
* **Phobias** (10 items)
* **Health habits** (3 items)
* **Personality traits, views on life, & opinions** (57 items)
* **Spending habits** (7 items)
* **Demographics** (10 items)

# Research questions

Many different techniques can be used to answer many questions, e.g.

* **Clustering:** Given the music preferences, do people make up
any clusters of similar behavior?
* **Hypothesis testing:** Do women fear certain phenomena
significantly more than men? Do the left handed people have different
interests than right handed?
* **Predictive modeling:** Can we predict spending habits of a person
from his/her interests and movie or music preferences?
* **Dimension reduction:** Can we describe a large number of human
interests by a smaller number of latent concepts?
* **Correlation analysis:** Are there any connections between music and
movie preferences?
* **Visualization:** How to effectively visualize a lot of variables
in order to gain some meaningful insights from the data?
* **(Multivariate) Outlier detection:** Small number of participants often cheats and randomly answers the questions. Can you identify them? Hint: [Local outlier factor][1] may help.
* **Missing values analysis:** Are there any patterns in missing responses? What is the optimal way of imputing the values in surveys?
* **Recommendations:** If some of user's interests are known, can we predict the other? Or, if we know what a person listen, can we predict which kind of movies he/she might like?
